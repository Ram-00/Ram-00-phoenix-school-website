    <h2>Admission Process</h2>

    <p>We appreciate your interest in Phoenix School! To ensure a smooth application process, please follow the steps outlined below:</p>

    <h3 class="step-heading">Application Submission</h3>
    <p>
      The first step is to complete our online application form. The application form can be accessed through our school website <a href="#">application form</a>. Be sure to provide accurate and complete information in all sections.
    </p>

    <h3 class="step-heading">Admission Interview</h3>
    <p>
      Once we receive your application, we will contact you to schedule an admission interview. This interview is an opportunity for us to learn more about your academic background, interests, and goals. It also allows you to ask questions and gain a deeper understanding of the Phoenix learning environment.
    </p>

    <h3 class="step-heading">Required Documents</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to the application form, you will need to submit the following documents:
    </p>
    <ul class="requirements-list">
      <li>Official transcripts from your previous school(s)</li>
      <li>Standardized test scores (if applicable)</li>
      <li>Birth certificate</li>
      <li>Letters of recommendation (optional, but encouraged)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="step-heading">Admission Decision</h3>
    <p>
      After careful review of your application materials and interview performance, the admissions committee will make a final decision. You will be notified of the decision via email within 4 weeks of your interview.
    </p>

    <p>
      We encourage you to review our <a href="admissions-info.html">Admission Information</a> page for further details about eligibility criteria, important dates, and financial aid options (if applicable).
